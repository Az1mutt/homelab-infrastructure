# Homelab Infrastructure

A documented migration from a working laptop-hosted media stack to a dedicated, headless Ubuntu Server platform.

The project is both a practical home infrastructure build and a public engineering portfolio. It focuses on reproducible deployment, storage safety, service recovery, honest status reporting, and incremental migration without losing the working source system.

## Project status

**Current phase:** desktop cutover complete; application validation and migration closure in progress.

- The media stack now runs on the dedicated Ubuntu Server desktop.
- The 18 TB Toshiba data disk is formatted as ext4 and mounted persistently at `/data`.
- Plex, Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, and SABnzbd are running successfully on the desktop.
- Migrated data and application state were validated with resumable copy checks and recovery-archive checksum comparison.
- A real Radarr post-migration download/import completed successfully.
- NTFS-era duplicate media/torrent payloads were converted to ext4 hardlinks, reclaiming roughly 711.6 GiB.
- Recyclarr now manages the main Radarr TRaSH quality profile.
- Automatic acquisition prefers Usenet; torrents remain manual/Interactive Search fallback.
- The old external source disk is still retained read-only as rollback media until final application validation is complete.
- A temporary Compose override pins known-good application versions so migration remains separated from upgrades.

Status details and evidence boundaries are tracked in [Current state](docs/current-state.md).

## Architecture at a glance

```mermaid

    Request["Radarr / Sonarr"] --> Prowlarr
    Prowlarr --> NZB["NZBGeek"]
    NZB --> Usenet["SABnzbd → Eweka"]
    Prowlarr --> Torrent["Torrent indexers"]
    Torrent --> qBittorrent
    Usenet --> Library["/data/media"]
    qBittorrent --> Library
    Library --> Plex
    Kometa --> Plex
```

The automatic path is Usenet-first. Torrents remain an explicit fallback for Interactive Search and exceptional releases.

## Repository principles

- Keep rollback media until the desktop passes final application acceptance.
- Separate confirmed implementation from plans and assumptions.
- Prefer read-only discovery before changing disks, filesystems, mounts, or services.
- Use persistent disk identifiers; never depend on `/dev/sdX` naming.
- Separate migration from upgrades and refactors.
- Treat storage capacity, redundancy, and backup as separate concerns.
- Never commit credentials, tokens, public IP addresses, private identifiers, disk serial numbers, or unsanitized configuration exports/backups.

## Near-term objective

Complete application-level validation on the desktop, then formally close the migration by retiring the old source disk, replacing the temporary migration-version override with a permanent update/pinning policy, and hardening backup and public-safe configuration.

## Scope boundary

This repository documents verified infrastructure state and planned implementation. It does not claim that automated off-host backups, monitoring, remote access, final update automation, or future storage expansion are complete until evidence is added.
